They want to see how far you can critically analyse the problem.

This depends on which 

What to do if version control is not provided by default?

If you cannot find software then you have to integrate a workflow process for people working on the project to follow version control for the current projects. So therefore integrate git into a workflow for people using it.

Consider the long term usage and support for purchasing the project.
Also consider the future usage for the software, invest into a piece of software that will likely be used in the future.

Must integrate well with GDPR and data protection.

Second it appears cross compatibility is essential.

Need to consider the cost of aquisition and ROI
Need to consider the license costs / maintenance / integration costs.
Need to manage the risks of outsourcing and the complexity, avoid re-inventing the wheel.
